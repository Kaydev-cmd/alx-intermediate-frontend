Command Line:

When you install Sass on the command line, you’ll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files. For example:

sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css
First install Sass using one of the options below, then run sass --version to be sure it installed correctly. If it did, this will include 1.89.0. You can also run sass --help for more information about the command-line interface.

Once it’s all set up, go and play. If you’re brand new to Sass we’ve set up some resources to help you learn pretty darn quick.

Install Anywhere (Standalone)
You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for your operating system from GitHub and adding it to your PATH. That’s all—there are no external dependencies and nothing else you need to install.

Install Anywhere (npm)
If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

npm install -g sass
However, please note that this will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed here. But it has the same interface, so it’ll be easy to swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more speed!

Install on Windows (Chocolatey)
If you use the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running

choco install sass
Install on Mac OS X or Linux (Homebrew)
If you use the Homebrew package manager for Mac OS X or Linux, you can install Dart Sass by running

brew install sass/sass/sass
